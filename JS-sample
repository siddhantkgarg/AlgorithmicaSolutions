Basics : 
1. Reverse an array in javascript. 
2. Swap alternate elements of an array : 
	E.g : [1,2,3,4,5] => [2,1, 4, 3, 5]
3. Find a substring in given string : 
	E.g: “Trade on opinions” => 
find “in”, => return true; 
Find “stack” => return false; 


Language basics: 
Using a map, get square of every element of given array : 
E.g [1,2,3,4]=> [1,4,9, 16]
Filter all elements divisible by 2 in a given array: 
Find index of a given element in the given array: 
Convert [[1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8, 9]] => [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
GIven array : 
[
{
	“event_id”: 111,
“Prop” : “aaa”
	
},

{
	“event_id”: 222,
“Prop” : “bbb”
	
},

]
          i.Convert this to a hashmap like structure, with event_id as key and prop as value: 
	 		{ [111] => “aaa”, [222] => “bbb” } 
         Ii. Convert this to a hashmap like structure with event_id as key and value of object as       value;
6. Find some of all elements of given array using reduce. 


Node basics : 
1. Create a new project, start a server using node and express and create following apis : 
	I. GET /file/id/1
	II. PUT /file/property/1
		{replace value of 1 with  {id : 1 , name : “exclamation”, symbol : “!”}}
          III. PATCH /file/id/1
		{replace value of symbol at 1 by #}
         IV. DELETE /file/id/1
  Create a file by name “symbols.json” with following initial values and run the API over this file : 
	
[
{
“Id” : 1,
 Name : “exclamation”,
Symbol : “!”



},
{
“Id” : 2,
 Name : “at_the_rate”,
Symbol : “@”



}, 

{
“Id” : 3,
 Name : “hash”,
Symbol : “#”



}, 

]
	


Create a blog for this : 
2. Setup mysql in local, and create a database with name js_kt and create a table with name “symbols” with the structure as in the file above. 
3. Now, create models in javascript and write the same apis on the table .
